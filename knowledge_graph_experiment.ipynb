    "\n",
    "The AWS ecosystem is designed to be **modular** and **interconnected**. Most services are not used in isolation but are combined to create scalable, secure, and efficient architectures. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **serverless web app** may use **S3** (static files), **API Gateway** (frontend API), **Lambda** (backend logic), **DynamoDB** (data storage), **CloudFront** (CDN), and **IAM** (access control).\n",
    "* A **data pipeline** may involve **Kinesis** (real-time ingestion), **Glue** (ETL), **Redshift** or **Athena** (querying), and **QuickSight** (dashboarding).\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS services cater to **developers, enterprises, data scientists, DevOps engineers**, and more, making it one of the most powerful and versatile cloud platforms in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like a **diagrammatic map** or a **cheat sheet PDF** of how these services relate, let me know—I can create that too.\n",
